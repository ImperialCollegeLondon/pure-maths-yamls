  #unnamed theorem: Every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a product of finitely many cyclic groups.
  #unnamed theorem: Every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a product of finitely
    #many infinite cyclic groups and finitely many cyclic groups of prime power order. The number
    #of infinite cyclic factors and the number of cyclic factors of order pr, where p is a prime and
    #r is a positive integer, depend only on the group.
